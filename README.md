# DevOps Mini Project – Automated Web Server Deployment

##  Overview
This project demonstrates a DevOps-oriented approach to automating the installation and configuration of a web server on Linux using Bash scripting.

The goal is to deploy a fully functional **Nginx web server** in a **repeatable, reliable and idempotent** way.

---

##  Objectives
- Automate web server installation
- Apply DevOps best practices
- Ensure service reliability
- Validate deployment automatically

---

##  Technologies Used
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
- Bash scripting
- systemd
- Nginx
- Git / GitHub

---

##  What the Script Does
The script performs the following actions:

1. Verifies root privileges
2. Installs Nginx if not already installed
3. Enables and starts the Nginx service
4. Deploys a static HTML page
5. Verifies service availability using `curl`
6. Logs all actions with timestamps
7. Can be executed multiple times safely (idempotent)

---

##  How to Run
```bash
sudo bash install_nginx.sh
